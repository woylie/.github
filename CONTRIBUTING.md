# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in the project!

## How can I contribute?

### Bug reports

If you encounter a bug, please search the issues for existing bug reports. If
the bug hasn't been reported yet, or in the case of a regression, open an issue
with the `bug report` template.

### Security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open an issue or a pull
request and refer to the [security policy](SECURITY.md) instead.

### Feature requests

I'm open to feature requests, whether you intend to work on the implementation
yourself or not. It is always helpful to hear how you use a project and where
it falls short.

### Pull requests

Pull requests are generally appreciated. If you plan to add a new feature or
change an existing feature, please open an issue first.

A good documentation is essential, so please don't hesitate to open a PR to fix
a typo or to improve the wording of unclear, incomplete or ambiguous
instructions.

Please make sure to:

- Run the linters, format checkers, tests and static analysis tools of the
  project locally before you push.
- Add tests that cover your changes. In the case of bug fixes, add a test that
  fails without the fix and that passes with the fix.
- Document new and updated features (preferably with examples, if applicable).

Make sure to reference the issue in your PR (e.g. `resolves #123`).

The PR titles or commit messages don't follow any particular convention. Just
try to be concise, descriptive, and limit the first line of your commit message
72 characters or less. Commit messages should be in present tense
(e.g. "add option to set max length").

The changelog follows the format described at
[Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). If you introduce breaking
changes, upgrade instructions using the `diff` markdown syntax are appreciated.
